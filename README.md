# Checklist-Task

 I have completed the checklist task according to the provided guidelines, ensuring the best possible UI design. The interface consists of a calendar on the left side and three main menu buttons on the right.

### Functionality Overview:
1. **Checklist Button**: 
    - **Add Checklist**: When clicked, a popup opens with fields for entering event details such as time and date. At the bottom, there is a button to add the checklist.
    - **Event Name Field**: Includes an edit icon and a plus button to add the checklist.

2. **Edit Icon**:
    - Clicking the edit icon opens fields to edit the selected checklist item.

3. **Add Button**:
    - Clicking the add button opens a popup with various fields and two buttons: "Cancel" and "Submit".
    - The popup can be closed by clicking the close icon in the header.

This layout ensures a user-friendly interface for managing checklists with clear functionality for adding and editing items.

 if you want to run the project, you have to create a JS file in the folder in that folder, there is space file and JS file and the team is file is separate image so separate for  calendar.
